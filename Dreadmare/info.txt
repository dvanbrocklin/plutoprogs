Dreadmare is a new game that I have been working on. It uses
LWJGL 2.9.3 and OpenGL 3.2. This is a 3D exploration game
similar to minecraft, but without blocks. As of right now it
is in the Testing Phase still (dm-20210204) so The only features
are as follows:

- A Spinning Gray Dragon
- A Flat grassy Ground
- 1000 randomly placed Trees
- The Ability to Move along the X, Y, and Z axis using WASD, SPACE, and LSHIFT
- You can not currently look around
